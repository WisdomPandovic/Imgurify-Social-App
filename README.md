# Imgur Project

- **Image Upload**: Logged-in users can upload images with titles, descriptions, and tags.

- **Tagging System**: Images can be tagged, allowing for easy categorization and discovery.

- **Liking and Disliking**: Users can like and dislike images, and the total number of likes is displayed.
